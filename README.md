# Pretty Progress

A pretty and simple progress bar for your React applications. ðŸš€

This project has a single screen or we can say a home page where user of the app simply can add ocassion and user details by just filling a simple form which is created using bootstrap forms and buttons.
On the right side of that there is a list section where all entires entered by the user will be displayed as a list which would be coming from direct redux store that previously user has entered and stored the data into redux store using `ADD_USER` action with `dispatch`.
